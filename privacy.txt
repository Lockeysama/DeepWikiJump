Privacy Policy
==============

**Effective Date:** August 7, 2025

Thank you for using DeepWiki Jumper!

We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the data practices for our Chrome extension, [Your Extension Name] (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension").

### 1. No Personal Data Collection

We want to be completely transparent: **The Extension does not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data or personally identifiable information (PII).**

* We do not track your Browse history or any data you type into web forms.
* We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information.
* All operations of the Extension are performed locally on your computer. Your data never leaves your browser.

### 2. Permissions Justification

To perform its core function, the Extension requires a single, minimal permission: `activeTab`.

* **`activeTab` Permission:** We request the `activeTab` permission for the sole purpose of allowing the Extension to execute its script on the web page you are currently viewing. This script runs **only when you explicitly click the extension's icon** in your browser toolbar. The script is used to access the page's URL path and the content of specific elements (such as href attributes via XPath) as required for the Extension's functionality. The Extension does not and cannot access or read any data from any tab in the background or without your direct action.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.

### 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the Extension's functionality changes. If we do, we will update the effective date at the top of this policy and provide notice through the Chrome Web Store listing.

### 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please do not hesitate to contact us.
